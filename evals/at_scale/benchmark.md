# At-Scale Code-Graph Benchmark

See issue #120 and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-at-scale-benchmark-design.md`.
Observational only -- no pass/fail thresholds.

The "cross-layer" ground-truth category (entries 5-6) demonstrates the two-query
valid-time-bracket pattern SKILL.md documents for decision-correlation — not a
single graph-level join. minigraf's current Datalog grammar has no documented way
to bind a fact's own `:valid-from` as an output variable or compare it numerically
within one query, so an agent must know the decision's timestamp out-of-band
(exactly as the seeded fixture does) and issue two `:valid-at`-bounded queries, one
on each side of it.
