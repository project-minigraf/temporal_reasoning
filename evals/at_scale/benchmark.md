# At-Scale Code-Graph Benchmark

See issue #120 and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-at-scale-benchmark-design.md`.
Observational only -- no pass/fail thresholds.

The "cross-layer" ground-truth category (entries 5-6) is a genuine single-query
graph-level join: it binds the seeded decision's own `:db/valid-from` as an output
variable via minigraf's `:db/valid-from`/`:db/valid-to` pseudo-attributes, then
filters structural facts by comparing each one's own `:db/valid-from` against it
in the same query (`[(< ?fvf ?dvf)]` / `[(> ?fvf ?dvf)]`). Removing the seed makes
either query return nothing, since `?dvf` could never bind. This capability exists
in minigraf and is already used internally by `mcp_server.py` (`_preload_known_deps`,
`_rebuild_index_from_graph`), but is not yet documented in `SKILL.md` — see #165.
An earlier version of this note incorrectly claimed no such mechanism existed and
shipped entries 5-6 as a weaker two-query valid-time-bracket workaround instead;
that was wrong and has been corrected here.
